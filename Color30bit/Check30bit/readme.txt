- To Run, type 
Check30bit

This will print out a listing of all attached displays and open a window on each display showing a teapot.
If a display is 30-bit capable, then the window opened on that display will use a 30-bit pixel format.
When moving or resizing the window between the displays the event handler determines if the window is spanning a 30-bit color compatible display and reports it.
